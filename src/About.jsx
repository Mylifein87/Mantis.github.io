            <p>
                Mantis is a Web Application written in Javascript using the React library. Powered by the Cloudmersive API, Mantis was created to help detect malicious content and threats by scanning URL's for malware and viruses.<br/>
                Most importantly I created Mantis to be used as a tool for thousands of Job Seekers applying for roles and recieving emails from unsolicited recruiters in an attempt to help deter Phishing attempts.<br />
